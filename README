# haiku
gentoo linux with
system configurations
and some eye candy

# branches
There are two branches in this repo, desktop and laptop. Each branch being for
configuration for a specific computer.

# repo layout
There are three directories in this repo each representing a btrfs subvolume.
The two distros I have installed, Gentoo and Void, are setup in a way that I can boot
from either without any issue.

# current hardware
Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 6

# Gentoo
I use Gentoo with musl libc and Clang systemwide. GCC is not installed on this system.
Configuration specific to Gentoo is located in the `gentoo` directory.

Many of the patches in this repo do not belong to me. I will provide a link where I
find these patches in the future to give proper credit.

# Void
For applications that require glibc, I have a chroot where Void is installed.
This chroot is bootable incase I ever need it. Configuration specific to Void
are located in the `void` directory.

# home directory structure
My home directory is read-only and contains seven directories:
bin   - Contains mostly scripts.
cfg   - The XDG_CONFIG_HOME directory. 
data  - The XDG_DATA_HOME directory.
doc   - Contains documents and repos.
media - Contains videos and images.
opt   - Contains software not installed system wide.
tmp   - Contains cache (XDG_CACHE_HOME is ~/tmp/cache) and other random files.

These directories can be changed in home/cfg/loksh/profile and home/cfg/user-dirs.dirs.

# notable things i use
wm:       wayfire
terminal: foot
editor:   Kakoune
shell:    loksh
launcher: bemenu
bar:      waybar

Some of the scripts used can be found in my scripts repo[0] and others can be found in home/bin.
This repo as well as the scripts repo can also be found on GitLab[1][2].

These configurations are specific to my system and are not guaranteed to work on yours.
