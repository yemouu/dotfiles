# Gentoo
I use Gentoo with musl libc and in a chroot, a normal Gentoo install.
Portage configurations for my main install are located in root/etc/portage.
Portage configurations for the chroot are located in root/media/glibc64/etc/portage.

# notable things i use
wm:       wayfire
terminal: foot
editor:   Kakoune
shell:    loksh
launcher: bemenu
bar:      waybar

Some of the scripts used can be found in my scripts repo[1] and others can be found in root/home/bin.

# home directory structure
My home directory is read-only and contains seven directories:
bin   - Contains mostly scripts.
cfg   - The XDG_CONFIG_HOME directory. 
data  - The XDG_DATA_HOME directory.
doc   - Contains documents and repos.
media - Contains videos and images.
opt   - Contains software not installed system wide.
tmp   - Contains cache (XDG_CACHE_HOME is ~/tmp/cache) and other random files.

These directories can be changed in root/home/cfg/loksh/profile and root/home/cfg/user-dirs.dirs.

# note
These configurations are specific to my system and are not guaranteed to work on yours.
