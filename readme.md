Configurations for programs that I use.

Alongside these configurations I also have a scripts which can be found on
either [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/yemou/scripts),
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/yemou/scripts), or
[GitHub](https://github.com/yemouu/scripts).

These configurations are intended to be distro agnostic.
Distro specific configurations can be found in other repos.
- NixOS (Desktops)
